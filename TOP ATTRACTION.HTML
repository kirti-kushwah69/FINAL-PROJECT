      <p class="para2">
        India is a vibrant land of startling contrasts where both the
        traditional and modern worlds meet. The world's seventh largest nation
        by area and the second largest in terms of population, India boasts a
        rich heritage that's the result of centuries of different cultures and
        religions leaving their mark. Things to do in India include the
        opportunity to experience an array of sacred sites and spiritual
        encounters, while nature lovers will enjoy its sun-washed beaches, lush
        national parks, and exciting wildlife sanctuaries.

            Dating back to the 8th century BC, Varanasi is one of the oldest
            still inhabited cities in the world. A major pilgrimage center for
            Hindus, this holy city has long been associated with the mighty
            Ganges River, one of the faith's most important religious symbols.
            Varanasi offers many reasons to visit, not least of them the chance
            to explore the Old Quarter adjacent to the Ganges where you'll find
            the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, built in 1780. The New Vishwanath
            Temple with its seven separate temples is also of interest. Also
            worth seeing is Banaras Hindu University, established in 1917 and
            noted for its massive library with more than a million books, and
            the superb Bharat Kala Bhavan museum featuring fine collections of
            miniature paintings, sculptures, palm-leaf manuscripts, and local
            history exhibits.

            Founded in 1577 by Ram Das, Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh
            history and culture. The main attraction here is Harmandir Sahib,
            opened in 1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for
            its beautiful gold decoration. The holiest of India's many Sikh
            shrines (it also attracts many Hindus and people of other faiths),
            the temple was built in a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles. Its
            lower marble section features such flourishes as ornate inlaid
            floral and animal motifs, while the large golden dome represents a
            lotus flower, a symbol of purity to Sikhs. In addition to its
            splendid design, visitors are equally impressed with the temple's
            spiritual atmosphere, an effect enhanced by the prayers continuously
            chanted from the Sikh holy book and broadcast throughout the
            complex.

            So named for the yellow sandstone used in most of its buildings, the
            Golden City of Jaisalmer is an oasis of splendid old architecture
            that rises from the sand dunes of the Thar Desert. Once a strategic
            outpost, today the city is filled with splendid old mansions;
            magnificent gateways; and the massive Jaisalmer Fort, also known as
            the Golden Fort, a daunting 12th-century structure that rises high
            above the town. In addition to its palaces, temples, and fine old
            homes, the fortress boasts 99 bastions along with massive gates
            leading to its main courtyard where you'll find the seven-story-tall
            Maharaja's Palace. Started in the early 1500s and added to by
            successive rulers right up until the 19th century, the palace offers
            sections open to the public, including areas beautifully decorated
            with tiles from Italy and China, and intricately carved stone doors.

            Construction of Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid, one of the world's largest
            mosques – and one of the oldest in India – began in 1614 during
            Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah's reign and took almost 80 years to
            complete. Large enough to accommodate 10,000 worshipers, this
            beautiful mosque's 15 enormous arches and pillars were each wrought
            from single slabs of black granite dragged to the site by huge
            cattle trains reputedly consisting of up to 1,400 bulls. Taking its
            name from the bricks above the central gate that were brought here
            from Mecca, this impressive complex features highlights such as its
            main gateway, a huge plaza, and a large manmade pond. There's also a
            room that houses the hair of Prophet Mohammed. Other notable
            features include inscriptions from the Quran above many of the
            arches and doors, the exquisite roof of the main hall, and the
            cornices around the entire mosque structure. Look out for the
            exquisite floral motifs and friezes over the arches.

            Long known within India as the "go-to" destination for those seeking
            a great beach holiday, Goa's beautiful western coastline,
            overlooking the Arabian Sea, has only recently been discovered by
            tourists from overseas. Goa's more than 60 miles of coastline is
            home to some of the world's loveliest beaches, each with their own
            particular appeal. For those looking for peace and quiet, isolated
            Agonda Beach is a good choice, while Calangute Beach is by far the
            most commercial and crowded. For those in search of posh resorts,
            yoga getaways, and spa vacations, the beaches of Mandrem, Morjim,
            and Ashwem are fashionable among wealthy Indians and Westerners
            alike. Palolem is another one of Goa's popular beaches in a
            beautiful setting.

            Standing an impressive 26 meters tall and overlooking the Arabian
            Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a must-see when in Mumbai. Built
            to commemorate the arrival of King George V and his wife Queen Mary
            in 1911, this stunning piece of architecture was opened with much
            pomp and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a while, the tallest
            structure in the city. Constructed entirely of yellow basalt and
            concrete and notable for its Indo-Saracenic design, the Gateway of
            India was also the scene of a rather less jubilant procession of
            British soldiers in 1948 when India gained its independence. These
            days, the huge archway provides a stunning backdrop that is as
            popular among locals as it is tourists. Hot Tip: After visiting the
            Gateway of India, pop over to the adjacent Taj Mahal Palace and
            Tower for a delectable High Tea, a fun thing to do in Mumbai since
            this lovely luxury hotel opened in 1903.

            One of South India's most popular tourist attractions, Periyar
            National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is centered around a lake built
            by British engineers in 1895 for irrigation and to provide water to
            the city of Madurai. Established in 1934, this beautiful park is
            home to numerous species of mammals, including a large free-roaming
            Indian elephant population, wild boar, otters, the lion-tailed
            macaque, and more than 20 Bengal tigers. Bird-watching is a popular
            activity with frequent sightings of species such as darters, storks,
            kingfishers, hornbills, and racket-tailed drongos, along with many
            interesting varieties of butterflies. The best ways to enjoy the
            park's splendid mountain scenery are to take a lake cruise or guided
            jungle walk, the latter allowing visitors a chance to come face to
            face with elephant herds and observe other wildlife from watchtowers
            and viewing platforms.

            The Ganges River, or "Ganga" after the Hindu goddess, has long been
            one of India's most revered natural wonders. It's also one of the
            country's leading attractions, drawing crowds of Indian nationals to
            partake in its religious ceremonies, as well as tourists to enjoy
            the splendor of this mighty river. While there are a number of
            cities dotted along the river, it's to the city of Varanasi that
            most tourists will travel to experience the Ganges and the cultural
            attractions that have sprung up along its banks. Although relatively
            small by Indian standards – its population is around 1.2 million
            people – the city is chock-full of temples and other important
            religious sites, many of them focused on worship of (or on) the
            Ganges. Numerous "ghats" are set along the river banks, making it
            easy for worshippers and tourists alike to get up close. Made up of
            sometimes steep steps leading directly into the water, there are in
            fact 88 of these entry points to the Ganges.

            excellent excursion from Mumbai, some 300 kilometers to the west.
            Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this remarkable collection of 34
            carved monasteries, chapels, and temples – 12 of them Buddhist, 17
            Hindu, and five belonging to the Jain faith – were built in close
            proximity to each other, a reflection of the religious tolerance
            that existed during this period of Indian history. Of the Buddhist
            monastery caves, highlights include a number of shrines featuring
            carvings of Buddha and saints dating from the 5th to 7th centuries,
            as well as the stunning Carpenter's Cave, considered one of the
