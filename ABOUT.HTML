            <h4 class="head1">Origins of the Indus Valley Civilization:</h4>
            <p class="para1">
              The earliest evidence of humans in South Asia dates back two million
              years. Beginning about 30,000 years ago, stone age hunters and
              gatherers inhabited sites in the area. Between 8000 and 6500 B.C.E.,
              there was a gradual shift from dependence on wild resources to
              domestic plants and animals. During the period between 5000 and 2000
              B.C.E., highly organized urban settlements spread throughout
              northern regions (present-day Pakistan and north India). 
            </p>
  
            <h4 class="head1">Indus Valley Civilization and the Rise of Indo-Aryan Culture:</h4>
            <p class="para1">
              Around 2600 B.C.E., regional cultures were united into a culturally
              integrated network in the Indus Valley region. Settlements in this
              civilization extended over a 650,000 square kilometer region. The
              peoples of the region shared a number of cultural characteristics,
              including planned urban developments, the use of a still
              undeciphered script, standardized weights, and craft technologies.
              The Indus Valley cultural system declined in the early centuries of
              the second millennium B.C.E., probably due to environmental changes
              in the region. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="head1">The Early and Classical Periods:</h4>
            <p class="para1">
              At first largely nomadic, Indo Aryan culture became increasingly
              urbanized and settled. New religious orientations arose, and some of
              the notions associated with classical Hinduism and the other major
              religions of the period--such as samsara, or the notion of
              rebirth--developed. Buddhism and Jainism were founded in the middle
              of the last millennium B.C.E., sharing some of the basic assumptions
              of developing Hindu thought but critical of the hierarchical and
              ritual system associated with the Vedic system. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="head1">The "Medieval" Period:</h4>
            <p class="para1">
              This period was characterized by the growth of strong regional
              centers and lack of one overarching political authority in the
              subcontinent. Sind in present-day Pakistan was integrated into a
              Muslim polity to the west; invasions by Turkic and Central Asian
              rulers commenced at the beginning of the second millennium C.E.
              Centralized powers were established, based at Delhi; independent
              regional kingdoms, however, continued. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="head1">The Mughals:</h4>
            <p class="para1">
              In 1526, the Mughal empire was founded by Babur, a Turkish/Central
              Asian chieftain whose ancestors included Chingiz Khan an Timur
              (known in the West as Tamarlane). His son Humayan was driven from
              India in 1540 and took refuge in the court of Shah Tahmasp in Iran.
              Mughal rule was reestablished, and under Akbar expanded across the
              north. Akbar moved against Rajput rulers, who were allowed to retain
              control over their land in exchange for their loyalty. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="head1">British Rule:</h4>
            <p class="para1">
              Although Europeans were present in South Asia as traders from the
              beginning of the seventeenth century, it was not until the middle of
              the eighteenth century that the British established rule in the
              region. As Mughal control waned in the eighteenth century, British
              power expanded. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British
              were ceded control of the province of Bengal. By 1857, the time of
              the First War of Indian Independence (or, as it was known to the
              British at the time, the "Mutiny"), the British were poised to take
              control from Mughal hands permanently. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="head1">
              The Modern Nation-States of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal:
            </h4>
            <p class="para1">
              In 1947, the independent nations of Pakistan (East and West) and
              India were formed out of the British empire in India; Nepal was
              never integrated into this empire. The partition of the subcontinent
              into separate nation-states is accompanied by tremendous violence.
              In 1971, East and West Pakistan divided into Pakistan and
              Bangladesh. Although relations among these nation-states are often
              tense, they share many cultural, as well as historical, ties. South
              Asians in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and other parts of Asia form
              a dynamic Diaspora community.
